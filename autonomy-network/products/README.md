# Products

Autonomy is primarily a B2B infrastructure tool, however in the short term, the team is creating user-facing products to demonstrate the feasibility and demand for new use cases that've never been done before and use that as a stepping stone to native integrations in other projects. For example, we created [AutoSwap](https://autoswap.trade/) to demonstrate to projects that limit orders and stop losses work on DEXes like UniswapV2 and its forks, which lead to integrations into projects like ApeSwap, with integrations into many more much bigger projects in progress.
